# Quine-McCluskey Method for Boolean Expression Minimization

## Overview
The **Quine-McCluskey algorithm** is a tabular method used for minimizing Boolean expressions. This project implements the algorithm to automate the process of finding the simplest Boolean expression from a given set of minterms and don't care conditions. It reduces complex Boolean expressions to their minimal form, making them more efficient for applications in digital circuit design.

This repository provides a C++ implementation of the Quine-McCluskey method that allows you to input a set of minterms and don't care terms, then outputs the minimized Boolean expression.

## Features
- Input minterms and don't care conditions in decimal form.
- Automatic generation of prime implicants.
- Identification of **essential prime implicants**.
- Reduction of the Boolean expression to its **minimal form**.
- Command-line based interface for user interaction.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler such as **g++**.
- A basic understanding of Boolean algebra and the Quine-McCluskey method.
